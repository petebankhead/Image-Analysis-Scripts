RepresentativeImageFinder is a script for finding truly "representative" regions of an image with stained cells. It generates annotations around a few small regions with average, high, and low local H-scores. These can be exported to ImageJ, saved as Tiffs, and inserted into a manuscript. Designed to help you avoid bias in selecting regions to show. 

FeretDiameter calculated the min and max Feret Diameter of all detection objects and adds them to the measurement list.
