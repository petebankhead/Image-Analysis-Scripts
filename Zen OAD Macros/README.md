How to run a Zen OAD Macro:

1) Download the file.
2) Find your Zen macro folder. It will be approximately here, but it will depend on your exact computer's set up (user accounts, etc): Documents\Carl Zeiss\ZEN\Documents\Macros\
3) Open Zen Blue (any version EXCEPT lite)
4) If you found the correct folder, the macro will appear under Tools> Customize Application > Macros >User Macros
5) Drag the macro to the right toolbar window. Then, a little button will appear in one of your toolbars that calls the macro.

-SlideScanner Flattening Macro: Whole workflow designed to remove artifacts caused by slides not laying perfectly flat in the slidescanner. Must have a minimum of 3 Z steps.
