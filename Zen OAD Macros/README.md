How to run a Zen OAD Macro:

1) Download the file.
2) Find your Zen macro folder. It will be approximately here, but it will depend on your exact computer's set up (user accounts, etc): Documents\Carl Zeiss\ZEN\Documents\Macros\
3) Open Zen Blue (any version EXCEPT lite)
4) If you found the correct folder, the macro will appear under Tools> Customize Application > Macros >User Macros
5) Drag the macro to the right toolbar window. Then, a little button will appear in one of your toolbars that calls the macro.


File Descriptions:

-RemoveScenes: 	Takes a multiscene image and copies the data into a single scene. This is designed for Axioscan data, especially when a TMA is inappropriately read as a series of independent samples. Works with birghtfield or fluorescence, but 1 Z, 1 time only!

-SlideScanner Flattening Macro: Whole workflow designed to remove artifacts caused by slides not laying perfectly flat in the slidescanner. Must have a minimum of 3 Z steps.

-AiryBatch: When doing Airyscan processing in Zen on a batch of files, it forces you to pick one filter strength for all channels. This will allow you to perform Airyscan processing on a folder of raw images with different Wiener filter strength for each channel. All .czi files in the folder will be processed with the same settings.
